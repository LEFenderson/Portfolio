Mantel correlation statistics are annotated in the chart inset. Plot shows the simple linear regression of the pairwise geographic distances among individual Saltmarsh Sparrow breeding marshes (given as great-circle distances) and their pairwise population genetic distances (calculated as linearized FST (FST/(1–FST)), with the best-fitting regression line to illustrate their relationship.
