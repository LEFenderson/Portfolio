### Isolation by Distance

Mantel correlation statistics are annotated in the chart inset. Plot shows the simple linear regression of the pairwise geographic distances among individual Saltmarsh Sparrow breeding marshes (given as great-circle distances) and their pairwise population genetic distances (calculated as linearized FST (FST/(1–FST)), with the best-fitting regression line to illustrate their relationship.
