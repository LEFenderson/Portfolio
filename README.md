### Isolation by Distance
#### Jump to [SALS Isolation by Distance directory](R/SALS%20Isolation%20by%20Distance)

Directory contains the relevant data and code used to generate the below figure depicting the simple linear regression of the pairwise geographic distances among individual saltmarsh Sparrow breeding marshes (given as great-circle distances) and their pairwise population genetic distances (calculated as linearized FST (FST/(1–FST)), with the best-fitting regression line to illustrate their relationship.

### Map of Saltmarsh Sparrow Sampling Sites
#### Jump to [SALS sampling map directory](R/SALS%20sampling%20map)

Directory contains the relevant data and code used to generate the below map depicting the saltmarsh sparrow breeding marshes sampled in Walsh et al. 2023[^1], highlighting the marshes where saltmarsh sparrow and Nelson's sparrow introgression occurs (blue points).
