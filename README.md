Figure 2 "Rangewide New England cottontail focus areas." published in:

*Fenderson LE (2012) Strategic Habitat Conservation for the New England Cottontail and
Associated North Atlantic Shrublands, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 24 pp.* 

This document was the preliminary project proposal submitted to the director of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service as the first step in new National Wildlife Refuge land acquisition. In October 2016, the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service approved the new [Great Thicket National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/great-thicket), dedicated to managing shrubland habitat for wildlife in the Northeastern United States.
